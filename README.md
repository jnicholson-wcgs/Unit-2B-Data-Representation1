# Unit-2B-Data-Representation-1
You have to implement the 6 functions in the Python template code
Each task is defined in the comments
For each task you have to change the return value of the function from 0xABAD1DEA to the return value you want of the correct return type
For two tasks, you have to add the correct parameters to the functio definition

When you run the code, it will automatically run the marking engine to give you a score

The marking engine will call your funtions with a set to test data to check that the function works.

Good luck
